# Tumor Immune Cell Atlas (TICA) integration

In this folder you can find all the files related to the creation of the atlas: all the scripts leading to the integration of the datasets and the downstream processing of the atlas (clustering, annotation, etc.).

The input to this pipeline (not included in this repository) are the datasets listed in Table 1 of the paper (citation pending) as seurat objects.
